## Exercise with Star Wars API (SWAPI)
Using a gauge test, we want to invoke the API and check it for functionality. 

1. Please create a gauge specification file and define the test steps in it.
   - API: `https://swapi.dev/api/planets`, HTTP method: `GET`, Accept: `application/json`
   - Test requirement is to invoke the API and check that the HTTP status code is 200.
   - A sample specification can be found here `specs/example.spec`
   

2. Please implement the defined steps from the specification in a new java class. 
   - A sample implementation can be found here `src/test/java/StepImplementation.java`.


3. Execute your Gauge test!


4. Evalution of results.

Let's explore the world of Star Wars!
